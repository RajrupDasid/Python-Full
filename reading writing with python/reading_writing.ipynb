    "# Alternative File Reading Methods\n",
    "Once you have a file “object”, the thing returned by the open function, Python provides three methods to read data from that object. The read() method returns the entire contents of the file as a single string (or just some characters if you provide a number as an input parameter. The readlines method returns the entire contents of the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list is one line of the file. The readline method reads one line from the file and returns it as a string. The strings returned by readlines or readline will contain the newline character at the end. Table 2 summarizes these methods and the following session shows them in action.\n",

    "Read and return the next line of the file with all text up to and including the newline character. If n is provided as a parameter, then only n characters will be returned if the line is longer than n.

    "In this course, we will generally either iterate through the lines returned by readlines() with a for loop, or use read() to get all of the contents as a single string.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section is a bit of an advanced topic and can be easily skipped. But with statements are becoming very common and it doesn’t hurt to know about them in case you run into one in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have seen and practiced a bit with opening and closing files, there is another mechanism that Python provides for us that cleans up the often forgotten close. Forgetting to close a file does not necessarily cause a runtime error in the kinds of programs you typically write in an introductory programing course. However if you are writing a program that may run for days or weeks at a time that does a lot of file reading and writing you may run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the notion of a context manager that automates the process of doing common operations at the start of some task, as well as automating certain operations at the end of some task. For reading and writing a file, the normal operation is to open the file and assign it to a variable. At the end of working with a file the common operation is to make sure that file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python with statement makes using context managers easy. The general form of a with statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "with /create some object that understands context/ as /some name/:\n",
    "\n",
    "    do some stuff with the object\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "When the program exits the with block, the context manager handles the common stuff that normally happens at the end, in our case closing a file. A simple example will clear up all of this abstract discussion of contexts. Here are the contents of a file called “mydata.txt”."

    "# Writing Text Files\n",
    "One of the most commonly performed data processing tasks is to read data from a file, manipulate it in some way, and then write the resulting data out to a new data file to be used for other purposes later. To accomplish this, the open function discussed above can also be used to create a new file prepared for writing. Note in Table 1 that the only difference between opening a file for writing and opening a file for reading is the use of the 'w' flag instead of the 'r' flag as the second parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with that name is created and made ready to accept our data. If an existing file has the same name, its contents are overwritten. As before, the function returns a reference to the new file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2 shows one additional method on file objects that we have not used thus far. The write method allows us to add data to a text file. Recall that text files contain sequences of characters. We usually think of these character sequences as being the lines of the file where each line ends with the newline \\n character. Be very careful to notice that the write method takes one parameter, a string. When invoked, the characters of the string will be added to the end of the file. This means that it is the programmer’s job to include the newline characters as part of the string if desired.\n",

    "Assume that we have been asked to provide a file consisting of all the squared numbers from 1 to 12.\n",

    "When we run this program, we see the lines of output on the screen. Once we are satisfied that it is creating the appropriate output, the next step is to add the necessary pieces to produce an output file and write the data lines to it. To start, we need to open a new output file by calling the open function, outfile = open(\"squared_numbers.txt\",'w'), using the 'w' flag. We can choose any file name we like. If the file does not exist, it will be created. However, if the file does exist, it will be reinitialized as empty and you will lose any previous contents.\n",

    "Once the file has been created, we just need to call the write method passing the string that we wish to add to the file. In this case, the string is already being printed so we will just change the print into a call to the write method. However, there is an additional step to take, since the write method can only accept a string as input. We’ll need to convert the number to a string. Then, we just need to add one extra character to the string. The newline character needs to be concatenated to the end of the line. The entire line now becomes outfile.write(str(square)+ '\\n'). The print statement automatically outputs a newline character after whatever text it outputs, but the write method does not do that automatically. We also need to close the file when we are done."
