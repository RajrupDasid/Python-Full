    "Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a syntax error. So does this one\n",

    "For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit. You will not be able to complete the execution of your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. However, as you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and you will also be able to find your errors faster.\n",

Exceptions are often defined as being “errors” but this is not always the case. All errors in Python are dealt with using exceptions, but not all exceptions are errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception Handling Flow-of-control\n",
    "To explain what an exception does, let’s review the normal “flow of control” in a Python program. In normal operation Python executes statements sequentially, one after the other. For three constructs, if-statements, loops and function invocations, this sequential execution is interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For if-statements, only one of several statement blocks is executed and then flow-of-control jumps to the first statement after the if-statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops, when the end of the loop is reached, flow-of-control jumps back to the start of the loop and a test is used to determine if the loop needs to execute again. If the loop is finished, flow-of-control jumps to the first statement after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For function invocations, flow-of-control jumps to the first statement in the called function, the function is executed, and the flow-of-control jumps back to the next statement after the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see the pattern? If the flow-of-control is not purely sequential, it always executes the first statement immediately following the altered flow-of-control. That is why we can say that Python flow-of-control is sequential. But there are cases where this sequential flow-of-control does not work well.\n",

    "# Raising and Catching Errors\n",
    "The try/except control structure provides a way to process a run-time error and continue on with program execution. Until now, any run-time error, such asking for the 8th item in a list with only 3 items, or dividing by 0, has caused the program execution to stop. In the browser ActiveCode windows, you get an error message in a box below. When you are executing python programs from the command-line, you also get an error message saying something about what went wrong and what line it occurred on. After the run-time error is encountered, the python interpreter does not try to execute the rest of the code. You have to make some change in your code and rerun the whole program.\n",
